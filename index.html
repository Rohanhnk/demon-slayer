    <h1>Demon Slayer S1</h1>
    <div class="season1">
        <div> <h2 class="s1">Summary</h2>
    <p>The series sets Tanjiro up as kindhearted, while also noting he possesses a sense of smell superior to that of a normal person, allowing him to perform near-supernatural feats, such as smelling the blood of demons. After selling charcoal in town, Tanjiro returns to find his entire family has been killed by a demon, save for Nezuko.

        Tanjiro, who is also a remarkably fast runner, bolt toward the nearest town. However, Nezuko attacks him. As Tanjiro tries to fend her off, they're confronted by Giyu Tomioka, one of the show's titular demon slayers. He reveals Nezuko has turned into a demon, and attempts to behead her with his Nichirin Blade, the only weapon capable of taking down a demon, provided it decapitates the monster. Tanjiro tries to protect Nezuko, but Tomioka easily knocks him out. However, something bizarre happens: Nezuko, whose demon nature should make her desire to eat anyone, including family, steps in to protect her brother. Tomioka knocks out Nezuko rather than kill her.</p>
       
        <P>After several days, Tanjiro's Nichirin Sword is delivered to him. Each of the swords takes on a different color depending on its user. Tanjiro's blade turns black, which is something of a cursed color, as those who wield that particular color don't tend to last long. Tanjiro and Nezuko (who is confined to a box during the day, as sunlight kills demons) set off on their first mission, which is relayed by the former's Kasugaigarasu, a crow companion who gives missions to the young demon hunter. Urokodaki explains to Tanjiro that a demon named Muzan Kibutsuji, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Michael Jackson, is the progenitor of all demons. That means he might know how to reverse Nezuko's condition.

            Tanjiro's quest eventually leads him to Asakusa, Tokyo, where he finds Kibutsuji, who is pretending to live as a human, going so far as to have a wife and child. However, the demon immediately proves himself capable and crafty, using his abilities to destroy anyone who gets in his way. After a confrontation with Kibutsuji gone awry, Tanjiro meets Tamayo and Yushiro. Although both are demons, they're actively working against Kibutsuji, as they're not subject to his control like others of their kind. Tamayo reveals she might be able to turn someone from a demon back into a human by using the blood of the Twelve Demon Moons, immensely powerful monsters who have been especially empowered by Kibutsuji.</P>

        <p> The first part, titled Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Mugen Train Arc,[a] is a seven-episode recompilation of the "Mugen Train" arc as featured in the 2020 anime film. It contains new music and an all new anime original episode which takes place immediately before the main story.

    <h1>Demon Slayer S3</h1>
    <div class="season3">
        <div><h2 class="s3">Summary</h2>
    <p>In the aftermath of the decimated Entertainment District, a battered Tengen Uzui emerges, having lost an arm and making the decision to retire immediately. Alongside him are Zenitsu and Inosuke, both comatose, and Tanjiro, who also succumbs to a coma shortly thereafter. Upon discovering them, A Kakushi swiftly signaled his colleagues and arranged for their transfer to the Butterfly Mansion, ensuring they received the necessary and proper medical treatment. 

      <h3> Demon Slayer Merchandise</h3> 
        
        In a rage, Muzan Kibutsuji summoned the remaining Upper Demon Moons to the Infinity Castle, and after expressing his rage at their failures, sent Gyokko and Hantengu to find and annihilate everyone at the Swordsmith Village. Back at the Butterfly Mansion, the demon slayer trio is already awake, and Zenitsu and Inosuke are sent on different missions, while Tanjiro focuses on rehab.
        
        When Tanjiro's swordsmith, Hotaru Haganezuka, declines to forge Tanjiro a new sword, he is instructed to rendezvous with him at the Swordsmith Village for a face-to-face discussion. With Nezuko in tow, Tanjiro encounters the village chief, Tecchin. The chief assures Tanjiro that he'll retrieve Hotaru to forge the sword. Tanjiro discovers the village hot springs and subsequently came in contact with Mitsuri Kanroji, Muichiro Tokito, and Genya Shinazugawa.
        
        <h3>Demon Slayer Swordsmith Village Arc Season 3 Tanjiro And Genya </h3>
        
        From a distance, Tanjiro watched as Muichiro argued with a young villager, and caught a glimpse of the back view of a man who he remembers from his dreams. For meddling, the indifferent Hashira knocks him out despite Tanjiro trying to defend himself. Upon rising, young Kotetsu reveals that the "man" he glimpsed is a cutting-edge robotic training doll crafted by his ancestors, and fashioned after a legendary swordsman from centuries past.
        
        <h3>Demon Slayer Swordsmith Village Arc Season 3 Tanjiro And Kotetsu</h3>
        
        Tanjiro vows to safeguard it, but Muichiro suddenly emerges, wreaking havoc to the doll after completing his intense training. Kotetsu eventually finds out that it still works and urges Tanjiro to train with it to surpass the cocky Muichiro. Training is tough for Tanjiro as Kotetsu withholds food and water from Tanjiro as punishment for failing to hit the doll.
        
        When Tanjiro eventually passes out, he dreams of the afterlife and spots a strange stone in the Sanzu River. This stone helps him sniff out scents even quicker than the Opening Thread. He cleverly exploits this new ability, landing a mighty blow on the doll's head, causing it to shatter and unveil a hidden sword.
        
        To Tanjiro and Kotetsu's dismay, the sword is tarnished. Hotaru appears, now buffed up from intense solo training, to craft a superior sword for Tanjiro. He then wrestled the old sword from Tanjiro and Kotetsu, with a promise to hone it. All the meanwhile, the two Demon Moons, Gyokko and Hantengu, have sneaked into the Swordsmith Village. Hantengu meets Nezuko, Tanjiro, and Muichiro (who swiftly beheads him)</p></div>

        <div><h2 class="s4">Summary</h2>
        <p>The Arc isn’t only concerned with Tanj’s training, but it will see the rest of the Hashira trying to awaken their Demon Slayer Marks in order to increase their strength and beat Muzan once and for all. During Demon Slayer season 3, we saw that Muichiro and Mitsuri gained their marks while fighting the Upper Rank 4 and Upper Rank 5 demons.

            With Tanjiro also having his Demon Slayer Mark ready to go, the rest of the Hashira need to join the crew if they have any hope of wiping out the demons once and for all. In order to awaken their marks, the Hashira must complete certain and (at times life-threatening) criteria – meaning they must push themselves to the limit to unlock their true potential.
            
            <h3>What season will be The Hashira Training Arc?</h3>
            The Hashira Training Arc will be covered throughout Demon Slayer season 4 and is the final stop before we begin the epic showdown between the Demon Corps and the demon lord Muzan.
            
            So yeah, basically, fans won’t want to miss this. While the Hashira Training Arc is focused more on the Demon Slayers internally than their fighting foes, it is a vital story beat to truly experience the upcoming finale. During this Arc, fans will get a closer look at all the Hashira’s backstories and will grow to love them more.
            
            Nothing is more exciting than watching anime characters you’ve just connected with be thrown into danger, So to fully appreciated the Demon Slayer finale, you’ll need to tune into Demon Slayer season 4.
            
            <h3>Hashira Training Arc explained: muzan smiling evilly in Demon Slayer season 3</h3>
            Who is the villain in The Hashira Training Arc?
            Although he doesn’t fight for the majority of The Hashira Training Arc, the main villain of Demon Slayer season 4 will be Muzan. After searching for Nezuko, Muzan’s spies discover the location of the Demon Slayer Corps’ headquarters.
            
            There we will see him have his first scuffle with the Demon Slayers before we head into the next story arc, the Final Battle Arc. So get ready to finally see the big bad demon lord in action, folks! And also, brace yourself to witness the intense build-up toward the final battle in the Demon and Demon Slayer war.</p></div>
